      "This app bagged multiple awards from our college(Best Thesis) to the region(Regional Champion) and national(Top 10) level. HospiLink is a web application that utilizes machine learning and Google Distance Matrix API to help EMTs transport the patient to the best suitable hospital in the shortest amount of time. I was a front-end developer who made the web app functional by rendering the data from our API, managed the states, validated the forms with react libraries, submitted the forms, made functional crud operations and animations. I was also a machine learning engineer who developed the model for predicting the hospital facilities, equipment and specialists needed by the patient. I was also a microservice developer who used the exported model and developed an API so applications can make requests to the API for predictions.",

The data is currently stored in local storage and later on, I plan to use Firebase to store some data quickly together with React Query for fetching and caching data; then Clerk for user authentication and management. I'll also be using Zustand for local state management. The projects are currently in the form of a pre-filled list and I plan to make it dynamic later on so user can add custom projects.",

It is currently only limited to iPad Air, mobile and Desktop/Laptop responsive. As a personal hobby, I plan to use React and convert the tags to semantic html for future improvements of this page as well as enahnce the responsiveness in other devices. The code is not entirely broken down into components but I plan to do some refactoring for further tweaking.",
